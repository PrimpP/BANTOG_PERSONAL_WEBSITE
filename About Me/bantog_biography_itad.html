            I have a lot of memories to recall from my <strong> childhood years </strong>.<sup>1</sup> As a child, I didn’t think of problems because I didn’t have any obligations.<sup>2</sup> My happiness is playing any kind of game, especially with my friends.<sup>3</sup> When I was in <em>pre-school</em>, my grandmother taught me how to go to school and back home safely.<sup>4</sup> My class schedule at that time is from Monday to Friday, with the second batch of classes in the morning.<sup>5</sup> I am always excited about going to school because I want to see my friends and play together.<sup>6</sup> When our class starts, I listen carefully to my teacher because if she calls me and I get the correct answer, I will get a star mark.<sup>7</sup> Every time I get a star, I'm so happy because my mother will give me a <b>reward</b>.<sup>8</sup> One of my favorite rewards is toy cars, because I have a collection of them.<sup>9</sup> During that time, I always fall asleep early and have plenty of sleep throughout the night.<sup>10</sup>
            Before the sunrise, I woke up and ate my breakfast.<sup>11</sup> After that, I will go outside and play with my friends until I get tired.<sup>12</sup> If I didn’t go home during lunch time my grandmother will find me and beat my ass.<sup>13</sup> I’m so nervous when I see her coming, holding a stick, and I'll try to hide somewhere.<sup>14</sup> Every time the rain comes, we are so happy.<sup>15</sup> It gave us a lot of fun, and we didn’t mind the <i>sickness</i>.<sup>16</sup> There’s one thing that comes to our mind when taking a bath in the rain, and that is to <i>make the most out of it</i>.<sup>17</sup> Every vacation, my cousins from different cities and provinces spend their vacation in our house.<sup>18</sup> We enjoy our vacation much more because of the bonding and hanging out together.<sup>19</sup> I’m so grateful that <em>my childhood</em> was full of fun and excitement.<sup>20</sup>

            My <strong> teenage years </strong>have been a great experience.<sup>1</sup> A lot of things are going on, it's extremely dynamic, and it's a lot of fun.<sup>2</sup> On the other hand, it's also a bit strange and difficult.<sup>3</sup> I no longer consider myself to be a <i>child</i> or an <i>adult</i>.<sup>4</sup> I began to sleep late at night because of playing games and having conversations with someone.<sup>5</sup> <em>In my appearance</em>, I became curious about my looks and the way I dress.<sup>6</sup> I’m eager to learn something that will help me grow as a person.<sup>7</sup> <em>As a teenager</em>, I used to go along with my friends and bond together.<sup>8</sup> I remember that during that time, we often went to a farm near our place.<sup>9</sup> There are a lot of vegetables and fruits on that farm, and its owner is very kind.<sup>10</sup> The only problem that we face whenever we go to the farm is the dogs, because they are so <b>feral</b>.<sup>11</sup> We become friends with the farm's owner's son, and they occasionally invite us to lunch with them.<sup>12</sup> If we have money, we buy food, and others share cooking materials because we will have our lunch on the farm.<sup>13</sup> We are free to use whatever materials we need on the farm.<sup>14</sup> The owner gives us variety of fresh vegetables that we add in our dish to make it more delicious.<sup>15</sup> We are also given different kinds of newly harvested fruits which we eat as a dessert.<sup>16</sup> <em>At school</em>, during breaktime, my friends and I go to a place where we can talk to each other.<sup>17</sup> If someone brings a guitar, we sing songs that make us happy.<sup>18</sup> One of our hobbies is playing basketball.<sup>19</sup> That’s why after our class we go to the basketball court and play some games.<sup>20</sup> During this time, I learned to do household chores, and the most frequently assigned task to me is washing our dishes.<sup>21</sup>

            The first thing I can say about my <strong> college years </strong> is that it has been an exciting process.<sup>1</sup> I’m grateful that I was given an opportunity to continue my studies in college.<sup>2</sup> I am also given the option of choosing the <i>career</i> which I wish to pursue.<sup>3</sup> That is why I am thankful to have <em>parents</em> like them who support me in my endeavors.<sup>4</sup> Being a college student is not easy because of the struggles and challenges along the way.<sup>5</sup> There are a lot of tough activities and tasks that need to be accomplished before the due dates.<sup>6</sup> It is so stressful, but at some point, it is a great experience.<sup>7</sup> I learn to deal with a variety of challenges, no matter how complex they are.<sup>8</sup> I stay calm and focus on what I’m doing to relieve the pressure.<sup>9</sup> There are many distractions available but I don’t want to get diverted from my goal.<sup>10</sup> That is what did whenever there are challenges around me.<sup>11</sup> I’ve had a lot of enjoyable experiences both inside and outside of school.<sup>12</sup> In school, I found a new circle of friends and we have commonalities in interests.<sup>13</sup> If we had vacant time, we used to go outside the school to relax while waiting for our next class.<sup>14</sup> When our class ends, sometimes I stay for a bit of time in school before I go home.<sup>15</sup> It happens mostly if we have a <u>P.E class</u>, because after that, we play basketball in the gym.<sup>16</sup> We spend Friday night together, making it one of our favorite days of the week.<sup>17</sup> It’s a great time for us to relax and chill after a stressful week.<sup>18</sup> Our Friday night is not complete without alcoholic beverages because these are our <b>comfort drinks</b>.<sup>19</sup> No matter how stressful the studies are, it is important to have fun and enjoy them.<sup>20</sup>
