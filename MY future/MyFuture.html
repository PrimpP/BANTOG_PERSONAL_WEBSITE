            When I haven't had much experience with life, it's difficult to think about my own personal future. There are so many options open to me. I'm not sure where I'll go tomorrow or if my mind will alter the next day or the day after. I can only hope that I make intelligent and responsible choices in my life. Every decision I make has an impact on the rest of my life. I am convinced that I have a bright future ahead of me and that I am on the correct track to a better life. I have no idea what the future holds, but I do know what my objectives and goals are. Hopefully, I will be able to accomplish everything I desire in the future, but for the time being, I will work diligently to get closer to my objectives.
            Graduating from college is a goal I anticipate myself achieving in the near future. I'm not sure what I want to do with my education or what I want to major in right now, but I am certain that I will graduate from college with a degree.

            A loving family is something I'd like to see in my future, in addition to a college education and a great job. Most women imagine the ideal family as consisting of a husband and a few children. Children, in my opinion, are not necessary for a happy household. Everyone has a family to begin with. People choose to enlarge their families as they grow older. I see a beautiful and supportive family in my future, although perhaps not as large as it is now. I picture myself marrying a nice man in the future, but that will happen after I finish college and have a successful profession.

            A career that pays well and offers outstanding benefits would be ideal in the future. Not only do I want to make a solid living, but I also want to enjoy whatever I do. Many people have jobs they don't care for. I envision myself liking my profession in the future. I'd want to have a long-term career rather than a temporary position. When striving to construct a life for myself, I believe that having a decent, steady job is critical. A steady employment will ensure that I have all of the things I desire in life without having to work hard for them. One of the most crucial aspects of my future is finding a job that I enjoy. A business owner is one occupation that I would like to pursue in the future. I'd like to be the owner of a large corporation. For the rest of my life, I could see myself running a business.
