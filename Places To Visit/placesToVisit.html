            I really want to personally see the amazing Eiffel Tower. Based on what I've seen on social media, the tower is not just about the breath-taking views. It is part of Paris's history and heritage, and its construction and design are quite impressive, with many stories. The gardens around the Eiffel Tower's esplanade have been recently renovated with gorgeous landscaping. The gigantic pillars provide a striking first impression; they are much larger than one would expect and are spacious enough to hold ticket elevators. While the tower’s construction was initially controversial, over time it has become the most iconic structure in Paris. In fact, it is one of the most well-known buildings in the entire world. People flock to the Eiffel Tower to take pictures in front of its classic facade, to enjoy the amazing views from the observation decks inside, and to see its dazzling nightly light shows. It’s also the focal point of many important events, including Paris’ Bastille Day and New Year’s fireworks celebrations.

        <h2 id="wall">Great Wall of China</h2>

        <a href="../Media/greatWallOfChina.jpg" target="winImage"><img src="../Media/greatWallOfChina.jpg" alt="Photo of Great Wall of China"></a>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            At least once in my life, I'd like to touch and stand atop the magnificent Great Wall of China. As I've seen on social media, the place is great for photography. Different scenes are presented in different seasons. Generally speaking, the best times to photograph are summer, when the wall goes up and down on the lush green mountains, and autumn, when its surroundings are a colorful fairy land. I'm sure that I will capture a lot of photographs, like selfies, panaromas, portraits, and more. If I am there, I will try to do all of the activities to the best of my ability. When I was studying in secondary education, my teacher discussed with us a brief overview of the history of the Great Wall of China and pointed out why we needed to visit it. I recall her saying that the Great Wall of China is China's most popular tourist attraction. A tour to China without the Great Wall is not complete. Most sites were built along mountain ridges in suburban areas, which have fantastic natural scenery and fresh air. I hope someday I will be there and physically see its natural beauty.

            Since I was young, I really wanted to go to Palawan because I was amazed by its exceptional beauty. Every time I see that place in any medium, I feel compelled to visit it. The island boasts many untouched beaches that are surrounded by crystal clear blue waters. It is one of the paradise islands of the Philippines and there is no doubt that anyone will aspire to visit it at least once in their lifetime. Just like me, if I was given the opportunity to be there, I would not waste time exploring the place. My cousin visited Palawan before, and she said that besides experiencing the island’s natural beauty, Palawan also offers several activities for fun-loving and adventurous tourists. Engage in snorkeling, scuba diving, and many more activities to make the most of what the island has to offer. Like me, I really like those kinds of activities, and I'm pretty sure I will enjoy visiting the island. As is true for Filipinos, the people of Palawan are exceptionally friendly, hospitable, and amazingly laid back. Foodies get to also enjoy the taste of freshly caught local fish and shellfish.
