            All of us have our own set of <b>skills</b> and <b>abilities</b>. That is what sets everyone apart. We are skilled in a variety of fields. Most of us realize our talents at different stages of life. We have at least one thing we are really good at. When each of us brings our individual talents together, we can turn things around. <i>Making good decisions</i> is one of my abilities. When it comes to judging particular situations, I have a good comprehension and better judgment. I’m grateful that I have it in my skillset because it makes sense. I come up with ideas that is useful for some reason. Sometimes I help people around me by giving better advice. My other skill is <i>multi-tasking</i>. There are times when I can do different tasks in the same period of time. That’s why I develop my knowledge and skills to perform some tasks quickly. Another skill that I possess is singing. Despite not having a good voice, I still love to sing because it calms me and I enjoy it. I am also good at cooking. My specialty is adobo and sinigang. Sometimes, I am good at dancing, especially when I am drunk occasionally. Lastly, I excel at playing badminton. I am not that good, but I can play well.

            I'm the type of person who has a wide range of <strong>interests</strong>. My day is incomplete unless I engage in at least one of my hobbies. Whenever I do my activities, I feel good. When I'm sick, the first thing that comes to mind is to do something I enjoy. One of my favorite hobbies is playing basketball. After doing my assigned tasks in school and house, I will go to the basketball court near our house to play. My uncle introduced that sport to me when I was in <i>preschool</i>. I always saw him watching basketball games on our television. That time, I had no idea about that game and I asked him to tell me some information about it. After he explained it to me, I felt it was interesting to learn to play. I asked my uncle to teach me to play basketball. It's a good thing my uncle granted my request and bought a basketball for me. We play in our small court in the backyard whenever he has free time. My other hobby is watching tv. I like to watch tv if I have free time. Watching tv is my hobby, but it did not affect my priorities. I prefer to complete my tasks and activities first before I watch tv. For me, I have a nice hobby because I get to learn from watching tv. I usually watch news and discovery networks on tv, including Science Channel. I also enjoy watching cartoons that inspire me to be more creative.

            I'm interested in a variety of <strong>activities</strong>, particularly those that make me joyful. One of those is listening to music. It provides me with a feeling of relaxation. Sometimes I have a hard time sleeping early at night. Playing and listening to music is my remedy to this problem.
            I tend to be interested in <b>programming</b> because it is challenging and at the same time educational. Another thing that interests me is watching vlogs. It makes me question how they cannot be shy in front of the camera while doing things. Maybe soon I'll put up my own vlog. Right now, I want to develop software and become the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates. I am currently interested in learning more about this new way to make money online using <b>block chains</b> and am putting forth effort to do so. I am currently studying the <i>Axie Infinity</i> with the hope of giving back early to my parents while studying.
